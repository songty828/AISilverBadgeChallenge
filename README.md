# AISilverBadgeChallenge
EY AI Silver Badge Challenge

Overall Objective: Our goal is to use natural language processing and other techniques to identify a subset of articles that will provide us insights and information on non-pharmaceutical interventions for Covid-19 and other related viruses in the CORD-19 dataset, which is a resource of over 195,000 scholarly articles. 
Specific characteristics of our solution are given below: 
o	Efficiently and effectively “read” through the dataset and narrow down the scope to key documents that contain information on non-pharmaceutical interventions. 
o	Further analyze the subset and systematically generate and identify key words and high frequency words
o	Create a document term matrix by applying LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to create an optimal number of “topics” to cluster the documents for further investigation
o	Analyze top frequency words within each topic, and associate them with target questions (please refer to “Task Details” on Kaggle for the specific target questions) to generate insights
o	Additional analysis was also carried out to compare LDA with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) in terms of topics generated on the same data set
o	Provide summaries and guidelines for audiences to leverage our results for further study
